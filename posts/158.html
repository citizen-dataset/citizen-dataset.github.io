  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>🗣 Chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Vyacheslav Volodin

💬 Two years ago today the Nord Stream attacks took place.

💬 The investigations of Germany, Denmark and Switzerland have not yielded any concrete results. Our country was not allowed to access the information needed to investigate the case , the process was dragged out to the maximum with the aim of covering up the evidence. The details have still not been revealed. Almost all of Russia's requests have been rejected.

💬 There is no trust in such investigations.

💬 Germany was hit hardest, its economy slipped into recession, GDP decreased, production patterns were disrupted, industrial production shrank, the number of bankruptcies reached a record high in the last decade. Gas became 84% more expensive for German citizens than before.

💬 I am convinced that the masterminds and perpetrators of the Nord Stream sabotage must be held accountable.

💬 There is no statute of limitations here.
