  <p>🚨‼️‼️Breaking: another CNN news  and political commentator dies suddenly. 

Alice Stewart pushed the Covid shot, pushed lockdowns, pushed all of the rhetoric and proudly announced. She was fully vaccinated. Publicly.


Alice Stewart was in phenomenal shape and extremely fit and athletic and Jake Tapper and all the other say they are in utter shock. 


Gee. It couldn’t have been the vaccines though because we know they are safe and effective and it is a coincidence that 20 million have already died suddenly or died of turbo cancer Since they got them.

I wonder how many more are going to die suddenly at CNN because I can barely keep up. Rest in peace.

PS if you got any of the shots, please for the love of God do a detox so you don’t  end up like Alice.</p>
