  <p>What do you think about headline news that Joe Biden has named Easter Sunday the transgender day of visibility. Let me know your thoughts below. Do you agree? Yes or no. I want everyone to see this. This is another reason that I convince so many Biden voting Democrat relatives with TDS, to vote for RFK.  Trump announced that he loves Bobby Kennedy is running because it helps his election. If you don’t encourage Biden voters to vote for Bobby then you can count on another four years of Biden and I don’t think that we will survive that.  https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-sparks-fury-proclaiming-easter-transgender-visibility-day-1885302</p>
