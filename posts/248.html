  <p>President Trump: The Trump Hating Judge in this case has gone off the rails. The case should have never been brought by the Corrupt, Racist Attorney General, but with any other Judge it would have been dismissed. Their Star Witness admitted he lied, “TRUMP did not Inflate Values.” The Judge says Mar-a-Lago is worth $18,000,000, when it’s 50 to 100 times that amount. I really believe he’s CRAZY! Also, I have a 100% Disclaimer Clause (reader beware!), and Financial Statements are Conservative. NO JURY! RIGGED CASE! He doesn’t care about Justice, but the PEOPLE, Lawyers, and Judges throughout the land see what is going on in his courtroom. Judicial and Prosecutorial Misconduct!!! Banks and Insurance Companies are witnesses for ME. They all made money, NO VICTIMS, No Defaults, No Complaints. This Corrupt Judge doesn’t even acknowledge or accept the decision of the Appeals Court. He Gags and Fines me constantly, for no reason. He should be thrown off the “Bench” as a giant Embarrassment to New York State!</p>
