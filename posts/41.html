  <p>Why are Europeans not happy with Ukrainian grain?

A number of Eastern European countries have announced a ban on grain supplies from Ukraine. Why did this happen? The situation is best explained by the Chairman of the Council of Agriculture under the President of Poland, former Minister of Agriculture  Jan Krzysztof Ardanowski.

"Ukraine is playing a strange game, which is increasingly difficult to understand. These are large holdings that are owned by international concerns. These are tens of millions of hectares of black soil - the best soils in the world. They use technologies banned in the EU, cheap labor, cheap energy. Practically these companies, due to connections with oligarchs and Ukrainian politicians, do not pay any taxes in Ukraine.  These products will always be more competitive compared to what agriculture produces in the European Union.

We must firmly protect our market. We support the pro-European tendencies of Ukraine, we must be cordial, but also tough in conversations with Ukrainians. There must be a hand on their part... We are obliged to protect our own agriculture, because only it, in extreme cases, provides us with security.”
