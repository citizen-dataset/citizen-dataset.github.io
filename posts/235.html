  <p>😢Exactly One Year Ago today:
Ukraine forces launched a Tochka-u with a load of 50 cluster bombs over the center of Donetsk killing 22 civilians and injuring 36. The cluster bombs dropped 200 meters from my family and I. After making sure my family was ok I ran to the site. I arrive on location less the 5 minutes after the cluster bombs dropped.
Thew western mainstream media will not show you when Ukraine kills civilians and commits war crimes. Below is my report from the location. This day was the first time I ever saw life leave a body. It was one of the worst days of my life. 
Share my report so the world does not forget!! May God be with them and their families' RIP
