  <p>Ukraine and Russia signed a Peace Deal a year ago, however Western interests didn't accept the Peace Deal.  It is clear they don't want Peace.

We know why BlackRock, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and others support Ukraine.

Ukraine the capital of :-

- Child Trafficking
- Adrenochrome
- Organ trafficking 
- Money Laundering 

Military is the only way
