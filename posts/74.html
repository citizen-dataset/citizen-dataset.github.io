  <p>🇯🇵 A Japanese Famous Politician (Ex-Minister), Kazuhiro Haraguchi,  Bravely Confessed In The Twitter Space That He Suddenly Developed Malignant Lymphoma After Forced Vaccination And Lost His Hair As A Consequence.

"I was forced to have the third dose of vaccination to go to Thailand. Right after vaccination, my tonsils swelled and I lost my voice. 

I was tested and found to have malignant lymphoma. My hair fell out all at once and I was shocked.  I hope that my message will be helpful to people suffering from similar illnesses (after vaccination)."
