  <p>🎙🇺🇸🇨🇳 INTERVIEW: US' Creeping Military Presence Along China's Periphery 

- US seeks to open new port 200km from China's island province of Taiwan; 

- US is sending military aid to Taiwan usually reserved for nation-states, undermining the US' own "One China" policy; 

- US "ACE" doctrine (agile combat employment) seeks to take centralized US air bases in the region, and distribute arms, aircraft and personnel across small airfields to make it more difficult for adversaries (China) to target/destroy US military assets if/when the US provokes war with China; 

- The US is using nations in the region, including the Philippines, as proxies against China similar to how the US is using Ukraine against Russia;</p>
