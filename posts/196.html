  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>This pretty much sums up our healthcare system in one short paragraph: this poor woman was convinced to cut both her breasts off to try to avoid getting breast cancer, which we know is proven not to work. Then they put in deadly toxic implants, which of course caused cancer, which is lymphoma which is also deadly and they had to pay her out because it was proven they were caused by the breast implants. This is the vicious cycle of the healthcare system, which is really the sick care system trying to keep you sick or nearly dying to make money off you for a lifetime.
