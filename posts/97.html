  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>Many experts would say they use predictive programming, as this just came out months ago, a film produced by both the Obamas. It’s entitled “leave the world behind”. 

Let me know your thoughts below. I polled my Twitter audience yesterday. Over 75% said they found the crash in Baltimore  to be suspicious. Most did not like that within minutes, the feds announced, before the bridge was barely in the water, that there was nothing suspicious about it. I guess that means no real investigation. Do YOU think  it was suspicious? Let me know yes or no below.</p>
