  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>Jim Caviezel calls out the mainstream media for attempting to cover up the truth about adrenochrome and the organ harvesting of children. 
Their attempts to fact check and silence those who wish to speak the truth about evil cannot be overlooked:
"I was willing to come forward and speak truthfully on things like adrenochrome, organ harvesting and was severely reprimanded by much of the media and they claim their fact checkers knew more. But they don't know like you know. It was a burden that I was no longer burdened with anymore. My career, I would never put in front of the children.
Go to the film Sound of Freedom, which represents  your word against these liars (the mainstream media).
Speak the truth to the American people."

The truth is beginning to shine forth. 
The world needs to awaken to the crimes being committed against our children by those who are in power. 
The children must be saved.
