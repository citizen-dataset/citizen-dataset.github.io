  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>“I was wrong. We in the scientific community were wrong. And it cost lives.”

This article is from NEWSWEEK, people. NEWSWEEK. An opinion piece that covers much of what patriots have been so desperately trying to say for years. 

‘I can see now that the scientific community from the CDC to the WHO to the FDA and their representatives, repeatedly overstated the evidence and misled the public about its own views and policies, including on natural vs. artificial immunity, school closures and disease transmission, aerosol spread, mask mandates, and vaccine effectiveness and safety, especially among the young. All of these were scientific mistakes at the time, not in hindsight. Amazingly, some of these obfuscations continue to the present day.’

Please take the time to read this article in it’s entirety. When you’re done, push it to every social media platform possible - this is the type of dialogue we need now more than ever.
