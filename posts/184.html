  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>The illusion of time was used to limit humanity in their creative endeavors. With over 26,000 years of enslavement, time was the Reptilians ultimate control. Creating due dates, a 9-5 workday, weekends off. Preoccupying humanity's time with sports, entertainment, alcohol(al-khul) and television. It was by their design, spend time looking over there and not over here - everything was connected to pedophilia controlled by Reptilians and Operation Paperclip. Time, just like religions, money & suffering was their means of control. 

The 'root' (think Chakra) is where they locked humanity with nanites. Keeping yourself fighting an Invisible Enemy, implanting thoughts directly into your mind with their technology. A perfect example, is a mirror - used as a portal to 'see' you and transmit thoughts, not a coincidence a mirror is to see one's reflection. 

Connect the dots, the next thought isn't your own. 

The world is about to change with higher levels of 'consciousness' what we refer to as 5D. 

It's time the world stands up and fights back. 

My fellow Americans, the Storm is upon US.....
