  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>Dave Smith & Joe Rogan on How Crony Capitalism is Crushing Everyday Americans

"There's more millionaires there than there are in any other part of the world, in the suburbs around Washington, DC. Is that because there's great big factories and they're making so much stuff that everyone wants to buy? No, that's because our centralized federal government spends over $6 trillion a year. And where does that money go? It goes into all the people who are connected to government...They're not making the country richer. They're extracting wealth out of the rest of the population...And then Wall Street is just printing money and then making your dollar less valuable...And this is basically why we live in this populist moment right now, where so many people are so freaking furious at the establishment, because they're right to be."
