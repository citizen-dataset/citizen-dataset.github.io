  <p>The Science Delusion | Rupert Sheldrake Banned TEDx Talk

TED ‘Bans' The Science Delusion.

Rupert Sheldrake gave a talk entitled ‘The Science Delusion' at TEDx Whitechapel, on 12 Jan 2013. The talk was censored by TED and, relegated to a corner of their website and stamped with a warning.
The theme for the night was Visions for Transition: Challenging existing paradigms and redefining values (for a more beautiful world). In response to protests from two hardcore materialists in the US, the talk was taken out of circulation by TED, relegated to a corner of their website, and stamped with a warning label.

Room for discussion was made, but those who condemned the talk never showed up. The vast majority of those who spoke out were outraged, including those who'd never heard of morphic resonance. Ironically, before the banning the video had a modest 35,000 views; since then its clones have been watched over 5 million times.
