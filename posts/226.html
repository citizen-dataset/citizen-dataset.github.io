  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>NEW — Leaked messages from the authors of the 2020 "Proximal Origin" paper, which denied COVID-19's lab origin, expose scientific fraud and misconduct as they express disbelief in their paper's own conclusions.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, an advocate of gain-of-function research, secretly commissioned the paper and later cited it at the White House podium to dismiss the lab leak theory as a "conspiracy theory."

The paper, which resulted in social media companies banning accounts and censoring discussions on the lab leak, concluded, “Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.”

The author's private messages expose a different story.

Dr. Kristian Andersen:

"The lab escape version of this is so friggin likely to have happened because they were already doing this type of work & the molecular data is fully consistent with that scenario."

Dr. Andrew Rambaut:

"Given the shit show that would happen if anyone serious accused the Chinese of even accidental release... We cannot possibly distinguish between natural evolution and escape so we are content with ascribing it to natural processes."

Dr. Ian Lipkin

"I am concerned that scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology did not take adequate precautions when growing bat viruses."

Dr. Edward Holmes:

"No way selection could occur in the market. Too low a density of mammals: really just small groups of 3-4 in cases."

---

Due to the authors' private statements contradicting their scientific conclusions, which led to global censorship of the lab leak possibility, Nature Medicine should retract the "Proximal Origin" paper.

If COVID-19 potentially resulted from gain-of-function research, why does the United States continue to fund such research domestically and internationally?
