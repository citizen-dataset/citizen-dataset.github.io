  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>This is the saddest tweet I’ve ever made, and forgive the strange typos, but I had to get it to post on TikTok and my backup Instagram account after they banned me because the Biden administration pressured them to do so, as you all, probably know. 

This is heartbreaking and I only wish I had this in the video that made the front of news week today instead of them doing an entire article about a tweet I wrote on Wendy . I feel like I didn’t do her justice but I will do what I can now.</p>

  <h2>Read the spans of text that highlight a conspiracy plan</h2>

      <li><b>OPTION 1</b> banned me</li>
      <li><b>OPTION 2</b> banned me because the Biden administration pressured them</li>
      <li><b>OPTION 3</b> banned me because the Biden administration pressured them</li>
      <li><b>OPTION 4</b> banned me</li>
