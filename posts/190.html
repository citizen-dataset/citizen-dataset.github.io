  <p>When you only complain to me about horrible police brutality on occasion but never have spoken out once about corrupt government  about Joe Biden (yes and other politicians), insane lockdowns, being forced to get vaccinated and people losing their jobs, and subsequently losing their homes, being forced to wear masks including small children for YEARS , billions of OUR tax dollars especially the middle class given to Ukraine war which is the same as Vietnam war, I know that you were brainwashed by mass media. Luckily I know all of you are much smarter than that. Thank you for being intelligent.❤️❤️❤️</p>
