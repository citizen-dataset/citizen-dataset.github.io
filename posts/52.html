  <p>⚡️📣 I am back in Donbass!! ⚡️📣      After spending some much needed time with my wife and 2 sons it is time for me to head back into the warzone for a long information push against the Mainstream media and show you what they keep trying to hide. Now is a very important time and the world needs a steady flow of English video reports from this side of the line. Now I think major movement can come at any point on the frontline as far as who controls what and I am determined to report on as much as possible. I am now in Donetsk then I will head across as much of the frontline area (including Russia's newly controlled territories) as I can to report in English(as always with full English and Russian Translations). Together we can show the world!</p>
