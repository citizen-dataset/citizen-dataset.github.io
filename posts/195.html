  <p>WEF Says US Must Implement 'One Child Policy' For White Families

The World Economic Forum has announced a controversial new policy that should have everybody who opposes eugenics up in arms.

Klaus Schwab’s WEF is now calling for the US to impose a strict ‘one child policy’ on all white families in an effort to promote diversity, reduce inequality, and usher in a new era of “post-politics” in which nobody in society disagrees on major policy issues.

Schwab’s new policy for America is clearly influenced by Chinese social policy which should come as no surprise.
