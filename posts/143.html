  <p>🇳🇿 Jacinda Ardern's Covid Response Created 'Two Classes Of People'

Rowan Dean says New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s "socialist" COVID response created “two classes of people”.

“That is what it is folks, that’s what you had in New Zealand, two classes of people, that’s your socialist governments for you,” 

“They believe, as George Orwell told us, that they are the source of all truth, there is no truth other than big Jacinda or big brother or big sister or whatever you want to call it, good riddance I say.”
