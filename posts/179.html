  <p>July 30:

It is becoming more and more glaringly obvious the 2 different tracks in studying Stellar:

1️⃣Those who follow the technology (like we do) and fully understand how IBM and Red Hat completely debunk other people’s frivolous and oft-delusional comments

🔤🔤

2️⃣Those who don’t understand anything at all because they choose to be lazy and not do any research themselves (or are too prideful/brainwashed to study our intel), causing them to abandon all logic



⚠️✔️And this is precisely why all of those other channels will be taken down during Social Media Bridges later (possibly starting as soon as 4-8mo from now) because whether unintentionally or not, they have continued to teach people the wrong intel and misspeak how the QFS is being developed and assets represented. And those following bad intel providers are consequently getting brainwashed by said bad intel… a vicious cycle the white hats will forcefully break to save people from themselves (after certain people continually prove their free will hinders progress)

These disinfo and misinfo agents actually prevent declas from happening, so they will be forcefully removed — just like how the crypto and physical bridges are being burnt and destroyed at the right time via ABC + SEP40 + PBFT

This is also why those other channels were not endorsed earlier and why Whip’s channel was not endorsed by induspayments and our devs unendorsed him, as Ben confirmed his channel will no longer be given the future “Official” TG title, but instead removed during 🔤🔤🔤🔤🔤🔤 🔤🔤🔤🔤🔤 🅱️🔠🔠🔠🔠🔠🔠
