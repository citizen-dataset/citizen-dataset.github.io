  <p>Pharmacies Are Turning into Vaccination Clinics... 
And we thought this was over and done.

Please do keep in mind that the USG pre-purchased these mismatched Kraken-strain "boosters" earlier this year, and now have to find ways to market them or they will confront a rather public embarrassment of large amounts of unused pre-purchased product - with congress questions.

Furthermore, data will come out concerning the effectiveness, safety (or lack), and potential negative effectiveness of these "booster" emergency use authorized (when no emergency exists) products.  Just in time for elections....  Wait for it.  Tincture of time.
