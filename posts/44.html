  <h2>Read the Telegram Message</h2>
  <p>During his travels to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Azerbaijan, Pavel Durov was joined by 24-year-old crypto coach and streamer Yulia Vavilova, who resides in Dubai. She was also by his side at the time of his arrest in France.

Leading up to August 24, Vavilova was actively sharing photos on social media from Durov's private jet and the various locations they visited together.

Now, speculation is growing that she might have been a spy involved in Durov's downfall—the very woman he intended to show around Paris. 

She was constantly posting photos and geolocations online, documenting Durov’s every move.
