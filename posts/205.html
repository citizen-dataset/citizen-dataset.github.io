  <p>The Disappearing Male | Marc De Guerre

"The Disappearing Male" is a stark warning of the potential dangers lurking in our everyday products. This groundbreaking documentary investigates the alarming rise in male reproductive issues, including genital deformities, low sperm count, sperm abnormalities, and testicular cancer. Simultaneously, boys and young men face heightened risks of disorders like ADHD, autism, Tourette's syndrome, and dyslexia.

Expertly crafted by Marc De Guerre, "The Disappearing Male" exposes the hidden culprits: a class of common chemicals found in shampoo, sunglasses, meat and dairy products, carpet, cosmetics, and baby bottles. With sperm counts plummeting by over 50% between 1973 and 2011, this critical issue cannot be ignored.

This must-watch documentary provides an eye-opening exploration of the potential risks associated with the chemicals we come into contact with daily. As the future of humanity hangs in the balance, "The Disappearing Male" is a powerful reminder of the urgent need to address these toxic threats.

The effects of these chemicals, known as bisphenols, were known long before this documentary was aired. In fact, they were discovered in the late 1800s. In his 1952 book, 'The Next Million Years' eugenicist Charles Galton Darwin wrote about putting chemicals in the food and water supply, using injections and other means to alter and reduce the population of 'useless eaters' aka the working class folks. This historical context adds a chilling perspective to the documentary, raising questions about the intentional use of these chemicals and their potential long-term effects on our health and society.
