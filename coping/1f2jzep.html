  <h2>Being queer and autistic sucks</h2>

  <p>Because of my school situation, I'm already pretty isolated with no chance of meeting anyone, but being gay just makes this 10x worse. I don't think I can ever imagine being in an actual relationship any time soon. It hurts and it's making me lonelier every day.</p>
