  <h2>Can We Talk About Things Being Discontinued?</h2>

  <p>The hand cream that I liked got discontinued a long time ago and it is really hard to find hand cream that doesnâ€™t give me sensory issues. The underwear that I love is now only available in India and Iâ€™m genuinely considering saving up to go all the way to India just to buy this underwear (Kayizu Womenâ€™s Cotton Hipster Underwear). The ones I still have are full of holes. The running shoes I got at Walmart for $30 many years ago were discontinued and I settled for $200 shoes that were most similar but still prefer the ones I got from Walmart, which I know sounds entitled and spoiled as fuck and I feel guilty about that. Now, this morning, I find out that the socks that I love have likely been discontinued because I canâ€™t find them online and Iâ€™ve been searching for hours. I only have one pair left.</p>
