  <h2>overly social aware</h2>
  <p><img src="https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1kyag3u/overly_social_aware/" alt="Cayman Logo" class="logo"></p>
  <p>I wish I had the normie skills of just going to a social gathering and just existing without analysing everyone and reading their patterns of behaviour instantly.
 
 early in adult life I did not seem to understand social cues and behaviour so much, so everything seemed so nice for me, at that point I did not care about what people thought of me and I was not aware of anything.
 
 but in college, after being traumatized by people, I had to take lessons and I hiperfocused on how to read people and I became very good at it, to the point I could predict what they were about to do or say.
 
 nowadays I just cannot go to parties or anything else because I will just see/feel everything and I'm always like an outcast-alien-invander-outsider.
 
 I tried to go to these master meetings at the local university and It just sucked, people were looking very weird at me, but this time I actually realized they were doing that. 
 
 fun thing: since a kid I was always "empath" because I'd suck other people's emotions just standing by their side, but I was not socially aware about how people were looking and perceiving me.</p>
