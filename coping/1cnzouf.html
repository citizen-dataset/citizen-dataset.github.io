 Thank you everyone for your help. This is an update of the previous post.
 
 I made an edit in a business document of someone, uploaded it to the website of the event as a proof. It worked. I got my ticket and attended the event. I pretended to be a businessman. It worked and I made valuable connections to other businessmen.</p>
