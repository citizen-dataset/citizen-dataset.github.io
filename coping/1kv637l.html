  <h2>Why do some people refuse to have media literacy</h2>

  <p>Just literacy in general tbh. I know this isnâ€™t a strictly nt problem but every single autistic/nd person I know loves going in depth into what theyâ€™re watching/reading and looking at all the different interpretations. but so many people are literally just that meme of â€œthe curtains are blueâ€ and say â€œi aint reading allatâ€ and it annoys me so much!!! I get it. Reading can be hard. Noticing all the different symbolism and messages can be hard. I literally have to reread a page 10 times over in order to comprehend it and rewind a scene because i realized I was zoning out. but thats because Iâ€™m fucking nd. whatâ€™s their excuse?? this makes me even more mad when itâ€™s for school. like you cant sit there for the twenty minutes weâ€™re actually reading and contribute to the convo/pay attention? aarhrhrhhdjsja. sorry if this is disjointed i just needed to get it out</p>
