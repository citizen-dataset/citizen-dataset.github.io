  <p>The year is 1991, I am 11 years old, and for the first time, Toronto is hosting the baseball all-star game. My parents and I live four hours away in Ottawa. One of the Ottawa newspapers holds a contest for ASG tickets - for the right to buy them, that is. Nothing else included, no spending money or hotel or anything.
 
 We enter the contest, dad and I, and we win! He buys the tickets and takes me (just us two guys) to Toronto for 2-3 nights to see the game. We stay at a mid-range hotel, a Holiday Inn or somesuch. We check in there and everything's great. The day before the game, he tells me we're going to go to the Skydome Hotel (the hotel built into the ballpark where some rooms overlook the field) to have a beer (him) and a Coke (me) at the lobby bar. But there is one condition, he tells me: You must Act Like You Belong. I am not allowed to stare wide-eyed at the people coming and going. I am not allowed to point at things. We're going to play it cool, he says.
 
 So we get there and I must have seen 2 or 4 guys who were obviously autograph hunters come in and get shown the door within about 20 or 30 minutes. He says, "that's why I told you to behave like I did".
 
 Eventually he motions with his head over to the elevators and says Rod Carew is getting out of one and into a cab. (I didn't know who Rod Carew was.) A short time later, paydirt.
 
 "That's Reggie Jackson sitting alone at the bar."
 
 He hands me a pen and a piece of paper and says, go over there, ask for an autograph.
 
 So I walk up to him, nervous as all hell, and say, "Excuse me, are you Reggie Jackson?"
 
 Reggie looks me up and down and says, "Son, there's no way you knew I am Reggie Jackson. Who are you with?"
 
 I motion to my dad. He gives my dad a little wave, asks me my name, and takes the pen and paper, signs an autograph to me. He says I have a great dad.
 
 And I have this beautiful memory only because my dad was teaching me to act like I belong.</p>
