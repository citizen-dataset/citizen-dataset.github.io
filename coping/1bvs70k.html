  <p>I just commented this on another post, but realized maybe it should just be it's own post tbh
 
 my mom was single, young, and bored when I was growing up, so she would take my siblings and I to strangers' weddings all the time, just as a way for her to dance, have fun, and drink. in return, we knew we'd get to have cake. there's a few especially popular wedding spots in our town that we'd sometimes pass by, and if there was one happening we'd always stop, and usually if the reception was already an hour or so in, no one would give a fuck that we just walk in. or when people would ask, she'd always tell me as a life lesson just to say you're a friend of "dave" or "mike" because there's always a dave, david, mike or michael (this worked for her at parties too). even when we clearly looked out of place (not in formalwear), people didn't seem to give a fuck if you're as friendly and nice as her. worst case scenario when people would be weirded out, she'd charmingly just explain to them how much she loves weddings, show off her cute kids, tell a sob story about her own love life, and they'd let her stay. we never once got kicked out. **one time she even got a dance in with the groom!** shoutout to my mom</p>
