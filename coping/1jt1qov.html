  <h2>rant about media being labelled as "autistic"</h2>

  <p>hello, im just gonna get straight to the point on this one and say that i really fucking hate when certain games and other shit get labelled as "autistic media". examples being sprunki, regrevator, or some random fucking object show or something. no hate to those who like it, obviously, like whatever you want. but when someone dislikes those games and they get jumped and called ableist because those have a "massive autistic fanbase" is just fucking stupid. it forces the "Silly" stereotype onto us, and just creates more reason for ableists to hate us. "self-dx" autistics don't realize that we can ACTUALLY HAVE other interests other than the average mascot horror game. im probably making no sense here.</p>
