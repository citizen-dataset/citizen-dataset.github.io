  <h2>My simple trick to get into Wimbledon Tennis (for free) in 2003</h2>

  <p>A long time ago now I was working for a PR agency that was tasked to give out free ice-creams to the long long queues of people waiting to get into Wimbledon
 
 Anyways, Wimbledon has an entrance for the players that come in by car. The guards simply open the gates and the car drives in with the players.
 
 I was giving out free ice-cream as a promotion of Haagen-Dazs. I waited patiently and when the gates opened I walked parallel with the car and darted to the right when I was in.
 
 I walked fast to a populated spot and gave out the remaining ice-creams to make out I was meant to be there and if anyone saw me walk in behind the car they'd think I went to go and get re-supplies.
 
 When I'd finished my stock of freebees I went and sat on the grass on the big screen and enjoyed an hour or so of the Tennis
 
 When the boss asked where I'd be I just said I took an early lunch</p>
