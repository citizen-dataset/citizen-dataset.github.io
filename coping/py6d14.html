  <p>Hi Iâ€™m Bella Iâ€™m from the uk i donâ€™t mind what pronouns people use but i mainly go by she/her I donâ€™t really know what to say but I like animals frogs especially and I like to draw and sing even tho Iâ€™m not that good Iâ€™m 14 but in March I turn 15. I am in high school year 10 to be exact im starting my gcse course work and my main subjects is art, business studyâ€™s and geography and I find it hard to make friends cause I canâ€™t continue a conversation so everyone just leaves me alone ;-; and I have a weird sense of humour based on my mental health and I just recently was diagnosed so I just wanted to see if anyone else had the same problems as me and have someone who relates to me (-sorry if I rambled a bit-) 
 Thx for reading all of this if u did sorry itâ€™s long
 
 (If u wanna talk more my Instagram is bea_976._ and say your from here and then introduce yourself please sorry if this sounds demandingðŸ˜…)</p>
