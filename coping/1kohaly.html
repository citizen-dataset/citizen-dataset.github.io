  <h2>Online Tests</h2>

  <p>Out of curiosity, I did two of the tests that a lot of self diagnosis people do. The blue is an autism test, which I do have, and the yellow one is an adhd test, which I don’t have. The fact that I got a moderate score for a disorder my diagnostician specifically said I don’t have is concerning for people using these to diagnose. I also asked my non autistic friend to take the autism test with the intent to get high on it, and they got a higher score than me.</p>
