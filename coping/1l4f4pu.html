  <h2>Being misunderstood in your second language</h2>

  <p>Do people often misunderstand you when you're using your second language?
 
 English is my second language, I've been studying it for 16 years and teaching it for 7 years. I know English, I probably know more about its grammar and other structures than a regular native speaker, however, people often misinterpret what I'm trying to say on discussions here on reddit and it makes me wonder if I don't know nearly as much as I think I do or if it's because of my autistic communication style.
 
 People usually complain about my tone and word choice, which is the same complaints I get on my native language, so I'd like to hear your experiences.</p>
