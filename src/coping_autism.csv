My parents and I live four hours away in Ottawa. One of the Ottawa newspapers holds a contest for ASG tickets - for the right to buy them, that is. Nothing else included, no spending money or hotel or anything.
 
 We enter the contest, dad and I, and we win! He buys the tickets and takes me (just us two guys) to Toronto for 2-3 nights to see the game. We stay at a mid-range hotel, a Holiday Inn or somesuch. We check in there and everything's great. The day before the game, he tells me we're going to go to the Skydome Hotel (the hotel built into the ballpark where some rooms overlook the field) to have a beer (him) and a Coke (me) at the lobby bar. But there is one condition, he tells me: You must Act Like You Belong. I am not allowed to stare wide-eyed at the people coming and going. I am not allowed to point at things. We're going to play it cool, he says.
 
 So we get there and I must have seen 2 or 4 guys who were obviously autograph hunters come in and get shown the door within about 20 or 30 minutes. He says, ""that's why I told you to behave like I did"".
 
 Eventually he motions with his head over to the elevators and says Rod Carew is getting out of one and into a cab. (I didn't know who Rod Carew was.) A short time later, paydirt.
 
 ""That's Reggie Jackson sitting alone at the bar.""
 
 He hands me a pen and a piece of paper and says, go over there, ask for an autograph.
 
 So I walk up to him, nervous as all hell, and say, ""Excuse me, are you Reggie Jackson?""
 
 Reggie looks me up and down and says, ""Son, there's no way you knew I am Reggie Jackson. Who are you with?""
 
 I motion to my dad. He gives my dad a little wave, asks me my name, and takes the pen and paper, signs an autograph to me. He says I have a great dad.
 
 And I have this beautiful memory only because my dad was teaching me to act like I belong.",ActLikeYouBelong,id,,

 I was giving out free ice-cream as a promotion of Haagen-Dazs. I waited patiently and when the gates opened I walked parallel with the car and darted to the right when I was in.
 
 I walked fast to a populated spot and gave out the remaining ice-creams to make out I was meant to be there and if anyone saw me walk in behind the car they'd think I went to go and get re-supplies.

 my mom was single, young, and bored when I was growing up, so she would take my siblings and I to strangers' weddings all the time, just as a way for her to dance, have fun, and drink. in return, we knew we'd get to have cake. there's a few especially popular wedding spots in our town that we'd sometimes pass by, and if there was one happening we'd always stop, and usually if the reception was already an hour or so in, no one would give a fuck that we just walk in. or when people would ask, she'd always tell me as a life lesson just to say you're a friend of ""dave"" or ""mike"" because there's always a dave, david, mike or michael (this worked for her at parties too). even when we clearly looked out of place (not in formalwear), people didn't seem to give a fuck if you're as friendly and nice as her. worst case scenario when people would be weirded out, she'd charmingly just explain to them how much she loves weddings, show off her cute kids, tell a sob story about her own love life, and they'd let her stay. we never once got kicked out. **one time she even got a dance in with the groom!** shoutout to my mom",ActLikeYouBelong,en,,

 early in adult life I did not seem to understand social cues and behaviour so much, so everything seemed so nice for me, at that point I did not care about what people thought of me and I was not aware of anything.
 
 but in college, after being traumatized by people, I had to take lessons and I hiperfocused on how to read people and I became very good at it, to the point I could predict what they were about to do or say.
 
 nowadays I just cannot go to parties or anything else because I will just see/feel everything and I'm always like an outcast-alien-invander-outsider.
 
 I tried to go to these master meetings at the local university and It just sucked, people were looking very weird at me, but this time I actually realized they were doing that. 
 
 fun thing: since a kid I was always ""empath"" because I'd suck other people's emotions just standing by their side, but I was not socially aware about how people were looking and perceiving me.",evilautism,en,,

I get it. Reading can be hard. Noticing all the different symbolism and messages can be hard. I literally have to reread a page 10 times over in order to comprehend it and rewind a scene because i realized I was zoning out. but thats because Iâ€™m fucking nd. whatâ€™s their excuse?? this makes me even more mad when itâ€™s for school. like you cant sit there for the twenty minutes weâ€™re actually reading and contribute to the convo/pay attention? aarhrhrhhdjsja. sorry if this is disjointed i just needed to get it out,evilautism,en,,
